# CodeWords - Word Guessing Game API
This guessing game is a fun JSON API game built with Spring Boot where players guess hidden words. This project demonstrates simple API design, state management, and clean coding.

## ðŸŽ® What is CodeWords?
**CodeWords** is a simple, turn-based word-guessing game played entirely through a RESTful JSON API. Think of it as a mashup between **Hangman** and **Wordle**, but without the graphicsâ€”just clean, logical backend interaction.

### ðŸ§© How the Game Works

1. **Game Start**
   - When a new game is started, the backend randomly selects a word (e.g., "apple").
   - The player sees a **masked version** of the word: `_ _ _ _ _` (one underscore per letter).
   - The player has a limited number of attempts (e.g., 6) to guess the word.

2. **Making Guesses**
   - Players can guess a **single letter** (e.g., "a") or try to guess the **entire word** (e.g., "apple").
   - Each incorrect guess reduces the number of remaining attempts by 1.
   - Correct letter guesses reveal that letter in its correct position(s) within the masked word.
   - If the player correctly guesses the entire word, the game ends immediately with a **WIN**.

3. **Game End Conditions**
   - **Win:** The player uncovers the entire word (via letter guesses or full word guess).
   - **Lose:** The player runs out of attempts before guessing the full word.

4. **Game Status**
   - The current status of the game can be:
     - `IN_PROGRESS`
     - `WON`
     - `LOST`

### ðŸ§  Example Game Flow

- Start a new game:
  - Server picks "apple" â†’ masked: `_ _ _ _ _`, attempts: 6
- Guess "a" â†’ masked: `a _ _ _ _`, attempts: 6
- Guess "e" â†’ masked: `a _ _ _ e`, attempts: 6
- Guess "i" â†’ incorrect, attempts: 5
- Guess "apple" â†’ correct! Game ends: `WON`

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Rules
- Each game starts with a hidden word (e.g., "apple").
- The user can guess a **letter** or the **full word**.
- A wrong guess reduces the remaining attempts.
- Game ends when the word is guessed or attempts run out.
